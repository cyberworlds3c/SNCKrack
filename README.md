# SNCKrack
It is a Password Cracking tool designed on Python.

Our tool is developed on python to crack passwords of excel and pdf files along with the support for different hashing algorithms like MD5,SHA256 & SHA512. we accomplished our goal of cracking passwords and hashes with an easy to use software  with just a few lines of python code 
And other available modules while keeping the hardware and software requirements to as minimum as possible but greater the hardware Faster the passwords will be cracked.
There are a few limitations but some can be overcome by optimizing the brute force dictionary and applying multithreading but one is Time which cannot be overcome  even  with powerful hardware as it is brute fore which tries all the combinations until the password is found . But in the end we have taken a step and achieved our goal .
